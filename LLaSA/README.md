pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
```

3. Install additional packages for training cases

```

### Upgrade to latest code base

```Shell
git pull
pip install -e .

# if you see some import errors when you upgrade,
# please try running the command below (without #)
# pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir
```

## LLaSA Training

Please run `scripts/pretain_llasa.sh` and then `scripts/finetune_llasa.sh`. Alternate hyperparameters can be used with `*_variable.sh` files. Example slurm-based hyperparameter tuning scripts are included as `hyperparameter_tune_sbatch.sh`. 

We are also attaching the original LLaVA training procedures for additional insight.

## Original Guidelines for LLaVA Training Procedure

*Below is the latest training configuration for LLaVA v1.5. For legacy models, please refer to README of [this](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/tree/v1.0.1) version for now. We'll add them in a separate doc later.*

LLaVA training consists of two stages: (1) feature alignment stage: use our 558K subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset to connect a *frozen pretrained* vision encoder to a *frozen LLM*; (2) visual instruction tuning stage: use 150K GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data, plus around 515K VQA data from academic-oriented tasks, to teach the model to follow multimodal instructions.

LLaVA is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` accordingly. Always keep the global batch size the same: `per_device_train_batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` x `num_gpus`.

### Hyperparameters
We use a similar set of hyperparameters as Vicuna in finetuning.  Both hyperparameters used in pretraining and finetuning are provided below.

1. Pretraining

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-v1.5-13B | 256 | 1e-3 | 1 | 2048 | 0 |

2. Finetuning

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-v1.5-13B | 128 | 2e-5 | 1 | 2048 | 0 |

### Download Vicuna checkpoints (automatically)

Our base model Vicuna v1.5, which is an instruction-tuned chatbot, will be downloaded automatically when you run our provided training scripts. No action is needed.

### Pretrain (feature alignment)

Please download the 558K subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset with BLIP captions we use in the paper [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain).

Pretrain takes around 5.5 hours for LLaVA-v1.5-13B on 8x A100 (80G), due to the increased resolution to 336px. It takes around 3.5 hours for LLaVA-v1.5-7B.

Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2: [`pretrain.sh`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/pretrain.sh).

- `--mm_projector_type mlp2x_gelu`: the two-layer MLP vision-language connector.
- `--vision_tower openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`: CLIP ViT-L/14 336px.

<summary>Pretrain takes around 20 hours for LLaVA-7B on 8x V100 (32G)</summary>

 We provide training script with DeepSpeed [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/pretrain_xformers.sh).
Tips:
- If you are using V100 which is not supported by FlashAttention, you can use the [memory-efficient attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682) implemented in [xFormers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers). Install xformers and replace `llava/train/train_mem.py` above with [llava/train/train_xformers.py](llava/train/train_xformers.py).

### Visual Instruction Tuning

1. Prepare data

Please download the annotation of the final mixture our instruction tuning data [llava_v1_5_mix665k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K/blob/main/llava_v1_5_mix665k.json), and download the images from constituting datasets:

- COCO: [train2017](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip)
- GQA: [images](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/gqa/images.zip)
- OCR-VQA: [download script](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_GYPY5UkUy7HIcR0zq3ZCFgeZN7BAfm_?usp=sharing), **we save all files as `.jpg`**
- TextVQA: [train_val_images](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/textvqa/images/train_val_images.zip)
- VisualGenome: [part1](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/images.zip), [part2](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/images2.zip)

After downloading all of them, organize the data as follows in `./playground/data`,

```
â”œâ”€â”€ coco
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train2017
â”œâ”€â”€ gqa
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
â”œâ”€â”€ ocr_vqa
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
â”œâ”€â”€ textvqa
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train_images
â””â”€â”€ vg
    â”œâ”€â”€ VG_100K
    â””â”€â”€ VG_100K_2
```

2. Start training!

You may download our pretrained projectors in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). It is not recommended to use legacy projectors, as they may be trained with a different version of the codebase, and if any option is off, the model will not function/train as we expected.

Visual instruction tuning takes around 20 hours for LLaVA-v1.5-13B on 8x A100 (80G), due to the increased resolution to 336px. It takes around 10 hours for LLaVA-v1.5-7B on 8x A100 (40G).

Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3: [`finetune.sh`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/finetune.sh).

If you are do not have enough GPU memory:

- Use LoRA: [`finetune_lora.sh`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/finetune_lora.sh). We are able to fit 13B training in 8-A100-40G/8-A6000, and 7B training in 8-RTX3090. Make sure `per_device_train_batch_size*gradient_accumulation_steps` is the same as the provided script for best reproducibility.
- Replace `zero3.json` with `zero3_offload.json` which offloads some parameters to CPU RAM. This slows down the training speed.

If you are interested in finetuning LLaVA model to your own task/data, please check out [`Finetune_Custom_Data.md`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Finetune_Custom_Data.md)ã€‚

New options to note:

- `--mm_projector_type mlp2x_gelu`: the two-layer MLP vision-language connector.
- `--vision_tower openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`: CLIP ViT-L/14 336px.
- `--image_aspect_ratio pad`: this pads the non-square images to square, instead of cropping them; it slightly reduces hallucination.
- `--group_by_modality_length True`: this should only be used when your instruction tuning dataset contains both language (e.g. ShareGPT) and multimodal (e.g. LLaVA-Instruct). It makes the training sampler only sample a single modality (either image or language) during training, which we observe to speed up training by ~25%, and does not affect the final outcome.

## Evaluation

In LLaVA-1.5, we evaluate models on a diverse set of 12 benchmarks. To ensure the reproducibility, we evaluate the models with greedy decoding. We do not evaluate using beam search to make the inference process consistent with the chat demo of real-time outputs.

See [Evaluation.md](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Evaluation.md).

### GPT-assisted Evaluation

Our GPT-assisted evaluation pipeline for multimodal modeling is provided for a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of vision-language models.  Please see our paper for more details.

1. Generate LLaVA responses

```Shell
python model_vqa.py \
    --model-path ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --question-file \
    playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_questions.jsonl \
    --image-folder \
    /path/to/coco2014_val \
    --answers-file \
    /path/to/answer-file-our.jsonl
```

2. Evaluate the generated responses.  In our case, [`answer-file-ref.jsonl`](./playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_gpt4_answer.jsonl) is the response generated by text-only GPT-4 (0314), with the context captions/boxes provided.

```Shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-***********************************" python llava/eval/eval_gpt_review_visual.py \
    --question playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_questions.jsonl \
    --context llava/eval/table/caps_boxes_coco2014_val_80.jsonl \
    --answer-list \
    /path/to/answer-file-ref.jsonl \
    /path/to/answer-file-our.jsonl \
    --rule llava/eval/table/rule.json \
    --output /path/to/review.json
```

3. Summarize the evaluation results

```Shell
python summarize_gpt_review.py
```
